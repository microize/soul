# TypeScript Best Practices for React Hooks (2024)

Based on current web sources, here are the key best practices:

## 1. Proper Hook Typing
Use specific types instead of `any`:
```typescript
const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);
```

## 2. Custom Hook Types
Define clear interfaces for custom hooks:
```typescript
interface UseApiResult<T> {
  data: T | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  refetch: () => void;
}
```

## 3. Generic Hooks
Make hooks reusable with generics:
```typescript
function useLocalStorage<T>(key: string, initialValue: T) {
  // Implementation
}
```
